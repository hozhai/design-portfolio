				Hi! I'm legally Fanhongmeng Zhai Fan, actually Hongmeng Zhai, technically <br />ç¿Ÿæ´ªè’™,
				usually just Zhai, and I go by he/him :)
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm a sophomore at Nido, and I've been here since 9th grade! Before that I was previously in
				2 other Chilean schools. I've been living in Chile since 2012, and I'm orignally from China,
				Shandong!
			</p>
			<p>
				As you may have noticed, I'm a massive coding nerd! I've been tinkering with computers since
				the age of 3, and at that point had already learned to type. In 2021, I received my first
				coding certificate from John Hopkin's Introduction to Web Development course on Coursera!
			</p>
			<p>
				Other than coding, I like biking, playing tennis, singing, photography, and playing guitar
				along with my saxophone! I've been having a lot of motivation to get into poetry recently,
				and I'm loving it so far (thank youuu Emiliaaa) &lt;333
