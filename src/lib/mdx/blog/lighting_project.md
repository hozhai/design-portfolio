# Welcome back!

For Design Tech, we have to design a solution utilizing our phone's flashlight in order to light up a space in a camping environment! It also needs to be adjustable in height, position, and/or light angle.

We started by making some napkin sketches in order to brainstorm how we could achieve this; accessories, modifications, brand new things outside the box, etc.

Napkin sketches are small sketches of quick ideas that are easy to make and don't need a lot of resources; hence napkins.

Here are some of the napkins!

A lot of these revolved around making the most out of the phone's flashlight or the phone itself (well, duh).

We did, however, need to make sure that the design we settled on had to have certain criteria and constraints. Criteria are goals we need to meet, and constraints are the limits we need to keep in mind for whilst trying to achieve these goals.

|                               Criteria                               |                            Constraints                           |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Has to be durable and reliable.                                      | Has to either have a reasonable size or be able to be assembled. |
| Needs to have an adjustable angle, and can also be secured in place. | The production cost must not include money.                      |
| Can actually light up areas and fulfill its purpose.                 | Needs to be able to be done before the project's deadline.       |
| Needs to be water resistant.                                         | We can only utilize materials found in the MakerLab.             |

With these criteria and constraints in mind, we made the aforementioned napkin sketches.

Then, we started having a group conversation (which was me and 2 others). We ranked the napkin sketches and gave feedback to each one of the napkins. I improved my design by combining two of my ideas, which were the case and the silicon lens into one.

<sub>Yeah... tilt your head please :)</sub>

After each of us did this, we converged (merged) our ideas by ranking each of them through a list and on different criteria!
