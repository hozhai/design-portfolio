# Welcome back!

For Design Tech, we have to design a solution utilizing our phone's flashlight in order to light up a space in a camping environment! It also needs to be adjustable in height, position, and/or light angle.

## Napkin Sketches

We started by making some napkin sketches in order to brainstorm how we could achieve this; accessories, modifications, brand new things outside the box, etc.

Napkin sketches are small sketches of quick ideas that are easy to make and don't need a lot of resources; hence napkins.

Here are some of the napkins!

A lot of these revolved around making the most out of the phone's flashlight or the phone itself (well, duh).

## Criteria & Constraints

We did, however, need to make sure that the design we settled on had to have certain criteria and constraints. Criteria are goals we need to meet, and constraints are the limits we need to keep in mind for whilst trying to achieve these goals.

|                               Criteria                               |                           Constraints                            |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                   Has to be durable and reliable.                    | Has to either have a reasonable size or be able to be assembled. |
| Needs to have an adjustable angle, and can also be secured in place. |           The production cost must not include money.            |
|         Can actually light up areas and fulfill its purpose.         |    Needs to be able to be done before the project's deadline.    |
|                     Needs to be water resistant.                     |       We can only utilize materials found in the MakerLab.       |

With these criteria and constraints in mind, we made the aforementioned napkin sketches.

## Feedback

Then, we started having a group conversation (which was me and 2 others). We ranked the napkin sketches and gave feedback to each one of the napkins. I improved my design by combining two of my ideas, which were the case and the silicon lens into one.

<sub>Yeah... tilt your head please :)</sub>

## Convergent Thinking

After each of us did this, we converged (merged) our ideas by ranking each of them through a list and on different criteria!

**[insert image here]**

We ended up with a product which is a phone case consisting of a built-in bolt designed to be used to stab inside trees or between rocks to fix the phone into place along with a amplifying cone which allows for the light to be amplified and have its angle adjusted.

## Sketches

We made 3 models of this: a product sketch which was an orthographic drawing, a physical model, and a digital model.

You can see the images attached below :)

## Final Reflection

All in all, it was a pretty fun project!

Here's a table comparing the three ways of representing a product :)

| **Criteria**        |  Napkin Sketches  |  Orthographic Sketches  |  Physical Model  |  Digital Model  |
|---------------------|:-----------------:|:------------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|
| Fast to make        |         ‚úÖ         |  ‚ùå                 | ‚ùå                | ‚ùå               |
| Needs few resources |         ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ                  | ‚ùå                | üü°*              |
| Interactive         |         ‚ùå         | ‚ùå                  | ‚úÖ                | ‚úÖ               |
| Tangible            | ‚ùå                 | ‚ùå                  | ‚úÖ                | ‚ùå               |
| Printable           |         ‚ùå         | ‚ùå                  | ‚ùå                | ‚úÖ               |
| Detailed            | ‚ùå                 | ‚úÖ                  | üü°*               | ‚úÖ               |

<sub>üü°* Could be, but also maybe not.</sub>

I did feel that the physical model helped me build a mental image of the product the most, simply because I'm a pretty visual person, and it's simply easier to navigate in 3D outside of a screen to see the features. Along with that, it's easy to have a sense of size and perspective as you hold it in your hand.

Something in the physical model that was not testable in the sketches was the proportions, whether it'd actually make sense or not, whether the weight was well distributed, etc. and ease of use in general.

When the physical model was created, I personally realized that adjusting the angle of the light cone would not be possible due to both material and skill confinements. The physical model's light refractor was made out of aluminum foil wrapped around a bottle cut in half, and there was simply no way anything else would be able to be better than that if we want to keep following the original design.

That's for now, thank you for reading!

Peace out, Zhai~
