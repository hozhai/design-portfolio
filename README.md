# Design Portfolio

> The old robotics-portfolio but better, and made with Svelte <3

---

The [old code](https://github.com/hozhai/robotics-portfolio) just, _sucked_. So I did what any other reasonable person would do: start from scratch using an entirely new framework following entirely new technologies.

The old one was for a foundations of robotics & coding class, and this one is for design technology. I may migrate the old markdown blog data to this one just for accessibility convenience.

## Run your own

1. Clone the project and cd into it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hozhai/design-portfolio
cd design-portfolio/
```

2. Install the packages (I use bun)

```sh
bun i
```

3. Run!

```sh
bun dev
```

Really wasn't that hard, huh?

## Contributing

I don't know why you would, but make an issue, make a PR, there's no format; tell me the issue, either fix it or let me fix it. And thank you.
